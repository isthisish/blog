It's 2018 and I finally have a blog (again). I've discovered Jekyll and the integration with Prose is pretty cool.

I don't want to hate on Wordpress because it wasn't that bad. But after playing around with Jekyll , I realize what I was missing. I never really enjoyed using the very rigid wordpress.com blogs. Self hosted wordpress.org blogs met my every need, well mostly.

But after using Jekyll I realize how I <!--more--> didn't really enjoy having those themes that got hacked and basically how I had that huge bloated CMS to just serve mostly static pages. (2008 me actually really loved Wordpress. I learned so much messing with and creating Wordpress themes and plugins. Those wordpress themes and sites did teach me a lot. And Wordpress isn't insecure by itself. Any popular platform is a target for hackers, but a Jekyll blog is just static pages.)

This post is just a "Hello World" and not a scientific comparison, but if you are looking for a platform to build a blog on, here is why Jekyll is good:
- Wordpress is overkill. It is a great CMS, but for a blog, it is beyond what most people need/use.
- You need a hosting service for Wordpress, if you don't use the Wordpress.com hosting service. Jekyll blogs can be hosted for free using [Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) and you own/control every aspect your blog.
- I remember during my undergraduate days I ran a washing machine reviews blog and it made me good pocket money. During the holiday season, I got a lot of traffic and I wouldn't name the provider, but my "shared" hosting plan was not good enough. No such issues with Github Pages and Jekyll is much lighter.
- I don't need to setup MySQL or worry about a plugin slowing down my whole site.
- I still remember the days of hacked Wordpress themes.
- Jekyll to me as a developer feels great and very customizable. I feel at home.
